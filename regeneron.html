        <h3>On January 10, 2024, Justin Xie, one of co-founders, had the honor of being named a Regeneron Science Talent Search (STS) Top 300 Scholar for his research on “Emotion and Sentiment Guided Paraphrasing.” This research pursues innovations for automatic emotion moderation of online discourse to foster a civil and cooperative cyberspace. Particularly, it targets the novel Natural Language Processing task of Fine-Grained Emotional Paraphrasing and proposes an accompanying Emotion-Gradient-Based Approach. This same research was also published in July 2023 at the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2023).
